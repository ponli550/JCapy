# JCapy Status Report: Orbital Architecture Split (Phase 7.2)
**Date**: February 21, 2026
**Status**: 🟢 Completed

## 🚀 Overview
We have successfully implemented **Phase 7.2: The Split**, a critical milestone in the JCapy 2.0 "Orbital Architecture". This phase decouples the user interface from the core execution logic, enabling a persistent background daemon to act as the "Brain" for multiple stateless clients.

## 🏆 Key Achievements

### 1. gRPC-Based Command Orchestration
- Implemented the `JCapyOrchestrator` gRPC service defined in `jcapy.proto`.
- Generated Python gRPC infrastructure and integrated it with the daemon server.
- Enabled real-time command execution and status reporting via gRPC.

### 2. Stateless CLI Client
- Refactored the `jcapy` CLI to act as a lightweight client.
- Implemented automatic discovery: the CLI detects if a local daemon is running and delegates commands automatically.
- Added robust fallback: if the daemon is unavailable, the CLI seamlessly executes commands locally.

### 3. Real-Time Log Streaming
- Built a gRPC-powered log streaming interface in the daemon.
- Enabled the CLI to stream execution logs directly from the daemon's internal event bus.
*   *Note: This provides a unified log view regardless of command complexity or duration.*

### 4. Infrastructure Stabilization
- Updated `jcapyctl.sh` to handle daemon lifecycle in production-grade environments.
- Optimized `PYTHONPATH` and dependency management for the daemon environment.

## 🧪 Verification Results
- **Command Delegation**: Verified successfully with `jcapy doctor` and `jcapy version`.
- **Latency**: gRPC protocol ensures near-zero overhead for remote orchestration.
- **Reliability**: Seamless transition between remote and local execution modes.

## ⏭️ Next Steps
- **Phase 7.3: Orbital TUI** - Migrate the main dashboard to follow the same stateless client pattern.
- **Phase 8.0: Multi-Agent Grid** - Focus on scaling the daemon to coordinate multiple autonomous agents.
